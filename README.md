# TNTUtils
This is a small mod that provides some utilities for explosions.

TNTUtils can be installed on a server without clients needing it.

Current features:
 - Disable explosions entirely (note that custom explosions from other mods may not be affected by this)
 - Prevent TNT from chain-reacting
 - A "/explosion" command
 - Prevent explosions from destroying
   - tile entities or
   - any specified block or
   - any blocks at all
 - Prevent explosions from damaging non-players
 - Prevent Creepers from destroying blocks ("environmentally friendly creepers")

These features are configurable.
